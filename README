This repository is a recreation of the personal website of Evan You (creator or Vue.js).

After stumbling across his website, and being satisfied with the minimal and pleasing aesthetic of the website, I decided to re-create it with my own information as a small study of HTML/CSS. 

By no means am I taking credit for any of this code, as such, it should be freely available to anyone who decides to use it for any reason, feel free to share and reuse!

The website can be viewed at:
